How to compile RTIViewer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile RTIViewer you need a C++ compiling environment and the following libraries:
- Qt 4.7 (http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads).
- the VCG libraries; this library is only accessible through anonymous svn (svn string:
  svn co https://vcg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vcg vcg ). The library must be at the
  same level of the folder 'components' and its root should be named 'vcglib'

The compiling step depends on the compiling environment. Using GCC (both under linux and
using the mingw gcc provided with the free Qt distribution) you should just type, from
the current directory:

qmake -recursive rtiviewerv10.pro
make

If you want to use Visual Studio, you can install the integration of the Qt tools into the
Visual Studio IDE (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/visual-studio-add-in) and import the top
level pro ( ~/components/RTIViewer/rtiviewerv10.pro ) into VisualStudio. Otherwise we shoud
type in the Qt Command Prompt from the '~/components/RTIViewer/' directory:

qmake -tp vc -recursive rtiviewerv10.pro

and open the project file.
